## Why I Built This App
I enjoy listening to music on YouTube whenever I'm programming, designing, or doing anything else that requires my focus. I didn't like that I had to continuously switch back and forth from whatever I was working on, to YouTube and back again. I wanted a small window that could would be small enough to place and move around anywhere on my screen while always remaining on the top so I could easily select a new video. Thus, YT PostIt was born.

This app was built using the [ElectronJS](https://www.electronjs.org/) platform using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was my first app using Electron, and the process could not have been more simple! Honestly recommend anyone trying to build a desktop app to check out their [docs](https://www.electronjs.org/docs).
